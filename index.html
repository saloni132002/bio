        <p>
            Hello! My name is Saloni Chitte, and I am a recent graduate with a background in civil engineering. 
            I have a passion for problem-solving and have applied my skills to various projects, 
            including the use of tar sheets for pothole repairs. Additionally, I am expanding my 
            knowledge in Python and SQL, working on projects that involve geotechnical engineering, 
            reinforced concrete design, and decision support systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am enthusiastic about continuous learning and currently improving my programming skills through practical courses. 
            I look forward to growing my expertise in both engineering and technology, leveraging my academic knowledge 
            and hands-on experience to contribute to innovative solutions.
        </p>
